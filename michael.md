## Michael-Owen Liston | Interaction and Service Design

#### Design, Collaborate, and Listen
I’m passionate about the intersection of human needs, technology, and design. I currently work as an interaction and service design consultant, alongside independent project work. I am based in Toronto, Canada, but available to travel or relocate worldwide. My previous clients and partners include the New York Public Library, and SickKids Hospital in Toronto.

As a creative and critical generalist, I love wrangling with the full spectrum of the designer’s toolkit, from strategic people-craft, to the not-so-fuzzy front end of the web, but I believe that deep listening, capacity for synthesis, and storytelling form the pillars of my practice. I’ve begun to explore the potential of video as a powerful tool for both prototyping and documentation throughout my process, and I’m excited to develop that skill-set further.

My current personal projects include TikilluaritSMS, a service I co-developed with Copenhagen’s Greenlandic community. It’s an SMS chatbot service that makes support and resources more accessible for vulnerable people in our communities. I am honoured that my IxDA 2016 Student Design Challenge submission “SMS Chatbots for Civic Engagement”, which was based largely off of this work, was selected as a finalist entry. I am also beginning to develop workshops for designers and others who would like to use video storytelling techniques in their practice. I co-founded Service Design Toronto with Linn Vizard in 2012.

Prior to entering the design field, I toured and recorded as a freelance double bassist for over a decade. I also worked at frontline mental health and harm reduction projects in both Vancouver and Toronto, including InSite, North America’s first supervised injection site. I am a graduate of the Copenhagen Institute of Interaction Design class of 2015.

#### Designing Critically, Thinking Critically
I built the current site you’re looking at as a static site, using Jekyll. I’d used WordPress in the past, but I wanted to challenge myself to avoid unnecessary bulk as part of both my design process and the site itself. My motivation is about more than efficiency for it’s own sake, however; a dynamic WordPress site consumes more energy every time it’s compiled, whether crunching databases on the server side or dumping loads of scripts onto the client’s browser, and I wanted to push myself to engage with the conspicuously neglected resource-consumption realities of the web. It’s an undeniably small-scale intervention, if you can call it that, but if you’ve read this far, it’s been worth it!
