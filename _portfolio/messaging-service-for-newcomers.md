## Help us test a new service to support refugee newcomers in Canada

We’ve been developing a service to connect refugee newcomers to volunteers via SMS text and voice messages, and we urgently need your help to test our first prototype! 

> ## We need both volunteers and newcomers to participate. We especially need volunteers who speak and/or read Arabic script.

### How does it work?

Newcomers can send questions about anything related to settlement or daily life—like who to contact about employment programs, or where to find specialty foods—and volunteers who are currently available will receive a notification, and the opportunity to respond to the question with a text or a voice message.

We will run the testing for a couple of days; you are free to participate as much or as little as you like.

* It’s anonymous; neither party can see the other person’s phone number.
* You will only receive notifications when you say you are available; you can log in and out with a single text message.
* You can stop your participation at any time.

### What do I need to do?

<a href="#signupform">Sign up here!</a>

Once we receive your information, we will contact you with the number for the service and you can get going right away.

You are under no pressure to respond to questions from newcomers. If you don’t know how to answer a question you can ask them for more information, or you don’t have to answer—the point of the service is that if you can’t, hopefully someone else can!

When the testing is completed we will invite you to submit your reflections on the experience, and you are also welcome to share feedback with us at any time. 

### Will this actually be a real service for newcomers?

We hope so! We will be looking to learn from our testing and seek support to develop the project further. Get in touch if you are in interested in learning more.

### Are there other examples of this kind of service?

Yes, we will update this list but here are a few quick examples of projects supporting refugees using low-barrier technologies like SMS:

* [Refugee Text Service (Denmark)](http://www.refugeetext.org/)
* [SMS’UP (France)](http://smsup.weebly.com/)
* [How Cellphones are Redefining the Syrian Refugee Crisis](https://www.devex.com/news/mobile-technology-for-mobile-populations-how-cellphones-are-redefining-the-syrian-refugee-crisis-87871)

### Who are you?

We are a two person research, design, and build team: Michael-Owen Liston and Manu Kabahizi. This project is being conducted with the support with Immigration, Refugees, and Citizenship Canada (IRCC), but we are not personally affiliated with the Federal Government of Canada.
