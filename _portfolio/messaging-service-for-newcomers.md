<h2 id="overview">An independent pilot project for Immigration, Refugess, and Citizenship Canada</h2>

We’ve been prototyping a service to connect refugee newcomers to volunteers via SMS text and voice messages. 

### How does it work?

Newcomers can send questions about anything related to settlement or daily life—like who to contact about employment programs, or where to find specialty foods—and volunteers who are currently available will receive a notification, and the opportunity to respond to the question with a text or a voice message.

### Will this actually be a real service for newcomers?

We hope so! We will be looking to learn from our testing and seek support to develop the project further. Get in touch if you are in interested in learning more.
