## Text and Voice Messaging Service for Newcomers



We’ve been prototyping a service to connect refugee newcomers to volunteers via SMS text and voice messages.

### How does it work?

Newcomers can send questions about anything related to settlement or daily life—like who to contact about employment programs, or where to find specialty foods—and volunteers who are currently available will receive a notification, and the opportunity to respond to the question with a text or a voice message.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Will this actually be a real service for newcomers?

We hope so! We will be looking to learn from our testing and seek support to develop the project further. Get in touch if you are in interested in learning more.

### Are there other examples of this kind of service?

Yes, we will update this list but here are a few quick examples of projects supporting refugees using low-barrier technologies like SMS:
