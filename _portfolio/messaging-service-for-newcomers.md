## Help us test a new service to support refugee newcomers in Canada

We’ve been developing a service to connect refugee newcomers to volunteers via SMS text and voice messages, and we urgently need your help to test our first prototype! 

> ## We need both volunteers and newcomers to participate. We especially need volunteers who speak and/or read Arabic script.

### How does it work?

Newcomers can send questions about anything related to settlement or daily life—like who to contact about employment programs, or where to find specialty foods—and volunteers who are currently available will receive a notification, and the opportunity to respond to the question.

* It’s anonymous; neither party can see the other person’s phone number.
* You only receive notifications when you have said you are available; volunteers can log in and out with a single text message.

### Will this actually be a real service for newcomers?

We hope so! We will be looking to learn from our testing and seek support to develop the project further. Get in touch if you are in interested 

### Who are you?

We are a two person research, design, and build team: Michael-Owen Liston and Manu Kabahizi. This project is being conducted with the support with Immigration, Refugees, and Citizenship Canada (IRCC), but we are not personally affiliated with the Federal Government of Canada.
