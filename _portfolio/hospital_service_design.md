As part of a small team at Normative, I conducted a range of research, synthesis, and strategy activities as part of a complete redesign of the SickKids hospital intranet system. Over 8,000 healthcare providers, researchers, and staff with a very diverse set of needs rely on the intranet to communicate, collaborate, and do their jobs. Intranet redesigns can be somewhat dull projects, but it was clear to us from the outset of this engagement that this was a tool that ultimately could have a direct effect on the quality of care experienced by the children and families who depend on the hospitalâ€™s services.
