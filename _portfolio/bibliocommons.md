At BiblioCommons, I worked as a lead UX designer, embedded in an Agile product development team, providing a range of SaaS solutions for public libraries around the world. At the time, the entire design team was about 4 people within a 50-plus sized company of engineers and support staff. I also “freelanced” for other teams as needed.

My work ranged from incremental improvements and bugfixes that could often be turned around in a matter of hours to the design and implementation of entirely new products and services for our clients.
