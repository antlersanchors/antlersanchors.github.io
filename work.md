## Portfolio of Work

Here are some projects I’m proud to share with you. I’ve chosen these ones because I think they can help tell a story about not just where I’ve been, but where I think I’m going.

I consider myself well-rounded in softer and harder skills, and in these projects I think you’ll see examples of my capacity to do the following:

__Research:__ Contextual interviews, participatory workshops, video documentation, strategic facilitation

__Synthesis:__ Collaboration, sketching, visioning

__Design:__ Paper prototypes, code prototypes, physical prototypes, wireframes, experience prototypes
