## Portfolio of Work

Here are some projects I’m proud to share with you. I’ve chosen these ones because I think they tell a story about not just where I’ve been, but also where I think I’m going.

I consider myself well-rounded in both softer and harder skills, and I excel at adapting my role to fit the needs of the team and the project at hand.
