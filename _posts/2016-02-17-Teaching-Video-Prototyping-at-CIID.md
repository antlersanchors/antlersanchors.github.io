I’ve just wrapped up a couple weeks of co-teaching the Video Prototyping course at the [Copenhagen Institute of Interaction Design](http://ciid.dk) — where I was until very recently a student in the graduate Interaction Design Program. It was a fantastic experience to be back (I hardly left, actually) and working with the infectiously enthusiastic, and unquestionably highly talented class of 2016, as well as two utterly marvelous partners in educational thought-crime, [Adam Little](http://www.localhiddenvariable.com/) and [Gizem Boyacioglu](http://www.gizembo.com/). I’m really pleased with how the course went, though a bit sad it’s over, so I thought I’d share some thoughts and reflections on what we got up to.
