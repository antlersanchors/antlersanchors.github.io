## Connecting Greenlanders in Denmark

TikilluaritSMS is a project to support Greenlanders who have recently arrived in Denmark. It aims to help them connect with resources — both governmental, and knowledge and experience within the community.

TikilluaritSMS uses a conversational SMS “chatbot” to engage with people who use the service. The chatbot can respond to a person’s natural language in a way that government websites and forms cannot. We want people to be able to describe their needs in a way that make sense to them, so that they can get the services that they need.

TikilluaritSMS is not meant to replace people, but rather to help people find each other. Understanding the range of services available can be overwhelming for people moving to Denmark, and we hope TikilluaritSMS can help make the experience as easy as texting a friend.

> TikilluaritSMS is the final project of Michael-Owen Liston, a Canadian designer and graduate student at the Copenhagen Institute of Interaction Design, [CIID](http://ciid.dk). The first prototype has been developed in collaboration with the Greenlandic community in Copenhagen. For more information, please contact Michael:
