## Connecting Greenlanders in Denmark

TikilluaritSMS is a project to support Greenlanders who have recently arrived in Denmark. It aims to help them connect with resources — both governmental, and knowledge and experience within the community.

TikilluaritSMS uses a conversational SMS “chatbot” to engage with people who use the service. The chatbot can respond to a person’s natural language in a way that government websites and forms cannot. We want people to be able to describe their needs in a way that make sense to them, so that they can get the services that they need.

TikilluaritSMS is not meant to replace people, but rather to help people find each other. Understanding the range of services available can be overwhelming for people moving to Denmark, and we hope TikilluaritSMS can help make the experience as easy as texting a friend.

## Hi I’m Michael

I currently live in Copenhagen. I do design stuff for a living. For fun I do other stuff. I care about these things. I would like to be a good ancestor.

About me, blah blah blah. Story telling.

Sweet picture.
