## Connecting Greenlanders in Denmark

TikilluaritSMS is a project to support Greenlanders who have recently arrived in Denmark. It aims to help them connect with resources — both governmental, and knowledge and experience within the community.

TikilluaritSMS uses a conversational SMS “chatbot” to engage with people who use the service. The chatbot can respond to a person’s natural language in a way that government websites and forms cannot. We want people to be able to describe their needs in a way that make sense to them, so that they can get the services that they need.

> TikilluaritSMS is the final project of Michael-Owen Liston, a Canadian designer and graduate student at the Copenhagen Institute of Interaction Design, [CIID](http://ciid.dk). The first prototype has been developed in collaboration with the Greenlandic community in Copenhagen. For more information, please contact Michael:
